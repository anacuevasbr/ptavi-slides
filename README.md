ptavi-slides
============

Slides used for the PTAVI (Protocolos de Transimisión de Audio y Vídeo por Internet) course.

This repository contains the slides (in Spanish) that are used in a Multimedia Engineering degree course at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (Madrid, Spain)

To generate the slides, LaTeX and beamer have been used (these software packages are common in GNU/Linux distributions, so they are easy to find and install). The beamer theme used is GSyC (the theme can be found in the repository). To generate the slides, you should have all of them properly installed on your machine.
